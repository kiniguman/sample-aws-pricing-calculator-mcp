# AWS Pricing Calculator MCP Server

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that programmatically builds AWS pricing estimates and generates shareable [calculator.aws](https://calculator.aws) URLs. Supports all 436+ AWS services via live service definitions from the AWS Calculator CDN.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
node mcp-server.js
```

The server communicates over stdio using the MCP protocol — it's designed to be used by MCP-compatible clients (e.g. Claude, Kiro), not called directly via HTTP.

### MCP Client Configuration

Add to your MCP client config (e.g. `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws-pricing-calculator-mcp-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/sample-aws-pricing-calculator-mcp/mcp-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `search_services` | Search AWS services by name or key. Supports comma-separated queries. |
| `get_service_fields` | Get input field IDs, types, labels, and valid options for one or more services. |
| `create_estimate` | Create a new empty estimate. Returns an estimate ID. |
| `add_service` | Add one or more services to an estimate with config values. Supports batch mode. |
| `export_estimate` | Export an estimate to calculator.aws and get a shareable URL. |

```

- The MCP server runs as a **local child process** spawned by the MCP client. It communicates exclusively over stdio — it is not network-accessible.
- All outbound requests are **HTTPS** to public, unauthenticated AWS CloudFront distributions. No AWS credentials are required or used.
- Estimate data is held **in memory only** and is lost when the process exits. No data is persisted to disk.

## How It Works

### Service Discovery

On first use, the server fetches the AWS Calculator manifest from CloudFront, which contains all 436+ services with their keys, names, and definition URLs. Service definitions are fetched on demand and cached. The `get_service_fields` tool parses these definitions to extract input field IDs, types, labels, and valid options into a flat, usable format.

### Estimate Building

`EstimateBuilder` holds services and groups in memory. When you add a service via `add_service`, config is stored as-is using the AWS field IDs. Services can be organized into named groups, and multiple instances of the same service are supported via composite keys (e.g. `aWSLambda:Compute`).

### EC2 Handling

EC2 uses a custom config transform (`lib/ec2.js`) that converts agent-friendly fields (instance type, OS, pricing strategy) into the `ec2Enhancement` format the calculator expects. This includes support for On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Spot pricing.

### Partition Support

The server supports three AWS partitions:
- `aws` — standard commercial regions
- `aws-iso` — US ISO East/West
- `aws-iso-b` — US ISOB East

### Export to calculator.aws

When `export_estimate` is called, the builder:

1. Resolves each service name against the manifest
2. Fetches the service definition to get the correct `version`, `serviceCode`, and template ID
3. Maps config keys to `calculationComponents` in the AWS payload format
4. POSTs the assembled payload to the AWS Calculator save API
5. Returns the shareable `calculator.aws` URL

AWS recalculates the actual costs when someone opens the link.

## Environment Variables

All optional:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AWS_MANIFEST_URL` | CloudFront manifest URL | AWS service catalog |
| `AWS_SAVE_URL` | CloudFront save URL | Estimate persistence |

## Caveats

- The CloudFront save/manifest APIs are undocumented and may change without notice.
- Callers must use the correct AWS field IDs — discover them via `get_service_fields`.
- Estimates live in memory and don't persist across restarts.
- No local cost calculation — pricing is computed by AWS when viewing the shareable link.

## Security

This is sample code intended for educational purposes. You should work with your security and legal teams to meet your organizational security, regulatory, and compliance requirements before deployment.

### Security Model

This MCP server is a **local tool provider** — it runs as a child process of an MCP client and is not network-accessible. It has no authentication or authorization layer; access control is the responsibility of the MCP client that spawns it.

The server does not handle AWS credentials, customer data, or PII. It processes only pricing configuration parameters (e.g., region, instance type, request counts) provided by the MCP client.

These are the same public, unauthenticated endpoints used by the [calculator.aws](https://calculator.aws) website. No AWS credentials are transmitted.

### Input Validation and Sanitization

- All MCP tool inputs are validated using [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schemas before processing.
- User-provided descriptions and group names are sanitized to remove `<`, `>`, and `&` characters before inclusion in API payloads, preventing HTML/XML injection in the calculator frontend.
- Service configuration keys are validated against AWS service definitions with typo detection (Levenshtein distance), rejecting invalid field IDs before they reach the API.

### Data Handling

- Estimate data is held **in memory only** for the lifetime of the process. No data is written to disk or persisted across restarts.
- The data consists of pricing configuration (region codes, service parameters, instance types) — not secrets, credentials, or personally identifiable information.
- Shareable URLs generated by the export contain only an opaque estimate ID. The estimate content is stored by AWS, not by this server.
